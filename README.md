Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development using the programming languages, algorithms,data structures and Software development methodologies to create applications and systems that meet user needs.
Software Engineering is important as it enhances productivity as it develops software structures that improve efficiency in various industries such as finance.
Software Engineering is important as it enables innovation in that it brings about technological advancements in areas such as cloud computing and Artificial Intelligence.
Software engineering is important as it supports growth of organizations that use it by making their operations seamlessly adapt to the changing market needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of Software Engineering in 1968 where the term was first introduced at NATO software engineering conference.This milestone highlights the period where software complexity was increasing but the then traditional programming approaches were inefficient.
Structured Programming in the 1970s whereby concepts such as modular programming were introduced bringing about languages such as Pascal.
Software Development Methodologies in the 1980s to 1990s where there was existence of the Waterfall Model and Object Oriented Programming bringing about languages such as Java and C+++

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The SDLC is the structured process used by software engineers to design, develop,test and maintain high quality software.
The first phase is the *requirement analysis* that involves understanding and documenting what the software should do in order to bring about clear understanding of the software expectations and project scope.
The second phase is *planning and feasibility study* that involves determining project feasibility and planning on the resources,timeline and a budget.
The third phase is *system design* which involves creating designs of the software to provide a blueprint for developers to follow during implementation.
The fourth phase is*development* which is basically the coding and implementation whereby the designs are converted into working software for a full system.
The fifth phase is *testing* which involves ensuring the software is bug-free and ready for use.
The sixth phase is *deployment* which involves release of software to end users.
The seventh and last phase is *maintenance and updates* which involves continuous improvement and support for the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In terms of flexibility,The waterfall methodology is rigid making changes difficult once a phase is complete while The Agile methodology is highly flexible and changes can be made whenever.
The Agile methodology is best for dynamic projects while the Waterfall methodology is best for large and well defined projects
Agile methodology operates at lower risks as issues here can be identified early while in The Waterfall methodology,higher risks are faced due to late testing and feedback 
Waterfall methodology limits customer involvement to the beginning while requirements are set out and at the end during testing while The Agile Methodology does not limit customer involvement since there is continuous feedback and collaboration throughout the process.
_Scenarios for their use_
A Waterfall Methodology can be used in a civil engineering set up such as building a bridge since it requires strict planning and approvals before and after execution.
An Agile methodology can be used in software development such as developing an app as it involves continuous customer user feedback and requirements may change often.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
_Software Developer_
Writes,tests and maintains code.
Debugs and fixes issues faced.
Collaborates with team members for code reviews.
_Quality Assurance Engineer_
Writes and executes test cases.
Identifies and reports bugs.
Works with developers to improve testing processes.
_Project Manager_
Defines the project vision, strategy and roadmap.
Ensures timely delivery of product.
Prioritizes features based on business needs.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
_Importance of IDEs_
Used in code editing.
Used in debugging and handling of errors.
Helps to improve code structure without breaking functionality.
Examples of IDEs are: Visual Studio Code,PyCharm and Eclipse.
_Importance of VCS_
Prevents code loss by providing backup and recovery
Allows for branching and merging of features 
Allows for collaboration since many developers can work on the same code base without conflict.
Examples of VCS:Git,Github and GitLab
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
*Constant Rapid Technological changes*
Strategy- participating in developer communities such as Stack and GitHub and also attending technology conferences and workshops to be up to date.
*Debugging Complex Issues*
Strategy-use of debugging tools effectively and seeking peer reviews for fresh perspectives.
*Communication and collaboration issues*
Comes about when there is poor communication which brings about misunderstanding.
Strategy -Use of collaboration tools such as stack and conducting regular team meetings encouraging open communication 
*Security Issues*
Strategy- Regularly performing security audits and applying the best security practices.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
*Unit Testing*
Involves testing individual components of a software application to ensure they work as expected.
Importance - detects bugs early and helps to maintain code quality.
*Integration Testing*
Verifies the interaction between two different components of an application to ensure they work together correctly.
Importance - Identifies communication errors between the modules and ensures the individual units work together as a system.
*System Testing*
Evaluates the entire software application as a whole yo verify that it meets specified requirements.
Importance - Identifies performance, security and usability issues and ensures the modules function together in a real world environment.
*Acceptance Testing*
It determines whether the software is ready for use by ensuring that it meets business requirements and user expectations.
Importance -Ensures software is usable and reliable.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts to effectively communicate with AI models ensuring they generate the best and most useful responses.
*Importance of prompt engineering*
_Optimizes user experience_
Makes interactions smoother and more beneficial.
_Improves efficiency_
Reduces the need for multiple iterations by providing precise instructions which are clear.
_Reduces Bias and Error_
Helps remove AI generated misinformation and unintended biases.
_Expands AI capabilities_
Allows users to achieve better in more complex tasks.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

*The vague prompt*- Tell me about presidents
*Improved prompt*-Provide a summary of the history of presidents in South Africa including their periods of reign and their key achievements in the country.
_Why the improved prompt is more effective_
The improved prompt is more effective since it is more specific as it states the presidents to be outlined in particular,it is more clear and  direct and the required details are well targeted.
